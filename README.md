Twitter API-based project for #codechella

How to run:
1. Run write_html.py
2. Click on the generated html page to look at results (potential NSFW warning)
3. If you want to post a translation, set up localhost by opening Git Bash in the 
codechella folder and typing the following: "flask run"
4. Once you set up localhost, enter the Japanese translation and press "submit" to post
a reply via the Twitter bot account. *Current version does not filter retweets, and thus
the sent post will not properly reply to the Tweet Owner. Check Tweet username before
submitting!
